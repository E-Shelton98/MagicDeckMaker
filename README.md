# mtg-deck-maker

mtg-deck-maker is an application built with React used for easily and efficiently creating Magic the Gathering decks and viewing relevant deck data such as mana costs, color balance, and spell types.

# Motivation

I am a big fan of MTG, and recently I have been struggling with finding a deck maker that I enjoy to use, so I decided I would simply build my own as a little side project.

# Tech Used

This program is currently built with React, and Chart.js while using react-chartjs-2.

The API used is ScryFall

# Code Style

Currently the program is using standard camelCase JS and kebab-case CSS.

# Features

Currently you can create a deck of x amount of cards, view details on the cards, and view charts that give you data on the deck such as mana curve, color variety, spell variety, land amount and land color variety.

Future features include the ability to remove cards from a deck, create and save multiple decks, handling and creation of a full collection adn viewing appropriate data, and many more. More exact details are listed on the about page in the program.

# Credits

Thanks again to Anthony Gregis for helping me out with my bug on DisplaySearchCards.js

Credit to Chase Wood, he has been working with the same API as me for his own style of project and we both helped each other out a few times being another set of eyes or figuring out this API. Thanks again Chase!
